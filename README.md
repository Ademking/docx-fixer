## Requirements 

* MS Office installed (2016+)
* â˜• Cup of coffee

## How to run

```

.\fixer.ps1 C:\path\corrupted.docx C:\path\new_fixed.docx

```

### Why

I was creating auto-generated DOCX files using [docx-templates](https://github.com/guigrpa/docx-templates). Those files cannot be opened with MS Word 2013 and below...
I made this script to repair those files.

### Note
The code is a bit messy but it is working fine. Feel free to clone and modify it according to your need.
